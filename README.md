# Deriving Streaming Graph Algorithms from Static Definitions

This paper describes how one could automatically derive streaming graph algorithms from the static definitions in terms
of the GRAPH-BLAS or Graph Algorithm Building Blocks (GABB). This repository contains code, data, and figures to support
the paper.
